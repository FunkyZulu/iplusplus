I++, free invoicing system
==========================

Introduction
------------

I wrote I++ because things like Odoo are overkill for a simple invoicing system. I++ is written in C++ using [mvcpp](https://github.com/rubdos/mvcpp), which is a lightweight [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) implementation in C++.

Writing stuff in things like Ruby on Rails takes several hundreds of megabytes of RAM, which, when ran on a VPS, takes a lot of money per unit of time compared to this.

Warning
-------

This program makes use of an sqlite database, of which the structure will be altered without prior notice. If you are interested in using this program, please get in touch and we'll arrange some form of database migration in mvcpp.
